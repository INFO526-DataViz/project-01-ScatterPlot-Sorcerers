The concept behind the show was to serve the guests with hot sauces which have varying heat and spiciness numbers on the scoville scale. The show often features rare and unique hot sauces from around the world, the spiciness of these sauces is measured by the scoville scale.\nBest Last Dab Reactions of All Time Video - In case you are unfamiliar with the show Hot Ones\nhttps://youtu.be/-at3oShfXH8?si=iYmT2YOsBiBPwFap\nHot Ones Episodes is a data set comes from the TidyTuesday repository. The Data Set that we choose contains three tables or three sets of data.\n\nThe first datset gives detailed information about the episodes\n\nIt contains the data about each episode until July 2023. The data set contains 300 observations.\nThe fields and the explanation of the episode data set are as follows\n\n\nepisodes.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nseason\nThe season number.\n\n\nepisode_overall\nThe overall count of episode, from 1-300\n\n\nepisode_season\nThe count of this episode within this season\n\n\ntitle\nThe title of the episode\n\n\noriginal_release\nThe date on which the episode was originally available on YouTube\n\n\nguest\nThe name of the guest\n\n\nguest_appearance_number\nThe number of appearances by this guest so far as of this date\n\n\nfinished\nWhether the guest finished trying all of the sauces\n\n\n\nThe second data set contains the data related to the sauces\n\nMainly it gives the description about the seasons in which the sauces were used and the Scoville scale reading (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale)\nIt contains 210 observations\nThe variables used and the interpretation of the data table is as follows\n\n\nsauces.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nseason\nThe season number\n\n\nsauce_number\nThe number of this sauce, from 1 (least hot) to 10 (hottest)\n\n\nsauce_name\nThe name of the sauce\n\n\nscoville\nThe rating of the sauce in Scoville heat units.\n\n\n\nThe Third data set contains the data related to seasons\n\nIt mainly shows the episodes per season, release date and the end date of the season. The data set contains record of 21 observations.\nThe variables used and their descriptions are as follows\n\n\nseasons.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nseason\nThe season number\n\n\nepisodes\nThe count of episodes in this season\n\n\nnote\nNotes about this season\n\n\noriginal_release\nThe date of the first episode in this season\n\n\nlast_release\nThe date of the last episode of this season (if that episode has aired at the time of scraping)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReason to choose the Dataset\nThe dataset represents an intriguing and distinctive topic. It is neither too small for meaningful analysis nor excessively large to hinder us from drawing conclusions. It pertains to a subject that not only our team members are familiar with but is also widely recognized. Having watched the episodes and gaining insights into the data collection process, we found it easier to connect with the dataset and analyze it more effectively."

    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nFor the first question, we plan on creating the variable “unfinished_count” which represents the number of guests that failed to try all the sauces for each season. Then we create another variable “average_scoville” which is the average of the variable “scoville” for each season. Then we can make a scatter plot in the first layer with “average_scoville” on the x-axis and “unfinished_count” on the y-axis. We will also add a geom_smooth in the second layer to analyse the trend. Here we calculate the “unfinished_count” variable from “episodes.csv” and the “average_scoville” variable from “sauces.csv”. We are planning to find out the season which has the most unfinished contestants and analyse the sauce score for that. This way, we will be able to tell if the average scoville score have any impact on the number of contestants that failed to try all the sauces.\nFor the second question, we plan on extracting the average scoville scale data of the sauces that appeared in each of the seasons, for all of the seasons, and draw box plots (or violin plot.). We will compare compare it to a bar plot which represents the entire length of the season as the seasons length (number of episodes) were not the same for each season. By doing this we will see if seasons that had a higher average number of scoville scale data had shorter seasons (number of episodes), and seasons with a lower overall average scoville scale number had more episodes within a season."
