Then we create another variable “average_scoville” which is the average of the variable “scoville” for each season. Then we can make a scatter plot in the first layer with “average_scovile” on the x-axis and “unfished_count” on the y-axis. We will also add a geom_smooth in the second layer to analyse the trend. Here we calculate the “unfinished_count” variable from “episodes.csv” and the “average_scovile” variable from “sauces.csv”.\nFor the second question, we plan on extracting the data of the sauces that appeared more than once in the series and plot a sunburst chart to visualize which season have more number of repetitive sauces."
